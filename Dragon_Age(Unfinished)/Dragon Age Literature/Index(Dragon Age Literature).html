									<h4>Canticle of Andraste</h4>
									<hr>
									
									<p><span class="span-h5">Andraste 1</span></p>
									<p><strong>Address and greeting</strong><br />
									Hear now, Andraste, daughter of Brona,<br />
									Spear-made of Alamarr, to valiant hearts sing<br />
									Of victory waiting, yet to be claimed from<br />
									The steel-bond forgers of barren Tevene.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste seeks an end to the suffering of the Alamarri</strong><br />
									Great heroes beyond counting raised<br />
									Oak and iron 'gainst chains of north-men<br />
									And walked the lonely worm-roads evermore.<br />
									Mighty of arm and warmest of heart,<br />
									Rendered to dust. Bitter is sorrow,<br />
									Ate raw and often, poison that weakens and does not kill.<br /></p>

									<p>Why must the Shield of Alamarr shatter<br />
									'Neath bond and blade? To the wisest I sang,<br />
									To the wing'd cup-bearers of the tall sky-vaulting,<br />
									To the wintry halls of strong mountain-kings,<br />
									Where in days forgotten, voices there raised<br />
									Might be gift'd answer and those seeking find.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Alamarri gods do not answer</strong><br />
									From sky-tearing peaks of the sacred mountain<br />
									To secret-steep'd roots of the ancient oak trees<br />
									A lonesome choir, I, song failing unanswered,<br />
									Voice on wind returning, answered no more.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste despairs for her people</strong><br />
									In heart's drumming I heard footsteps thund'ring<br />
									Shield-brothers and spear-sisters distant raised<br />
									Blade to shackle-bearer, valiant of spirit<br />
									Blazing like star-shine, to battle they charged.<br />
									None to return to the lands of their mothers<br />
									By cruel magic taken, ice, lightning, and flame.<br /></p>

									<p>Should for all seasons laments ring the sky-vaults,<br />
									Should dirges all sages and histories replace?<br />
									By gods forsaken, fate emptied of hope,<br />
									Wounded I fell then, by grief arrow-studded,<br />
									Never to heal, death for me come.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Maker appears to Andraste</strong><br />
									Eyes sorrow-blinded, in darkness unbroken<br />
									There 'pon the mountain, a voice answered my call.<br />
									"Heart that is broken, beats still unceasing,<br />
									An ocean of sorrow does nobody drown.<br />
									You have forgotten, spear-maid of Alamarr.<br />
									Within My creation, none are alone."<br /></p>

									<p>Lo! My eyes open'd, shining before me<br />
									Greater than mountains, towering mighty,<br />
									Hand all outstretch'd, stars glist'ning as jewels<br />
									From rings 'pon His fingers and crown 'pon His brow.<br /></p>

									<p>Sword-shattering fear filled me overflowing.<br />
									Grandeur of godhood no gaze should defile.<br />
									Trembling, I called out: "Forgive me, Most High,<br />
									I should sing Your Name to the heights of heaven,<br />
									But I know it not, and must be silent."<br />
									The Wellspring of All said, "None now remember.<br />
									Long have they turned to idols and tales<br />
									Away from My Light, in darkness unbroken<br />
									The last of My children, shrouded in night."<br /></p>

									<p>World fell away then, misty in mem'ry,<br />
									'Cross Veil and into the valley of dreams<br />
									A vision of all worlds, waking and slumb'ring,<br />
									Spirit and mortal to me appeared.<br />
									"Look to My work," said the Voice of Creation.<br />
									"See what My children in arrogance wrought."<br /></p>

									<p>There I saw the Black City, towers all stain'd,<br />
									Gates once bright golden forever shut.<br />
									Heav'n filled with silence, then did I know all<br />
									And cross'd my heart with unbearable shame.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste begs the Maker to give mortals another chance</strong><br />
									Then did I see the world spread before me,<br />
									Sky-reaching mountains arrayed as a crown,<br />
									Kingdoms like jewels, glistering gemstones<br />
									Strung 'cross the earth as a necklace of pearl.<br />
									"All this is yours," spake the World-Maker.<br />
									"Join Me in heaven and sorrow no more."<br /></p>

									<p>"World-making Glory," I cried out in sorrow,<br />
									"How shall your children apology make?<br />
									We have forgotten, in ignorance stumbling,<br />
									Only a Light in this darken'd time breaks.<br />
									Call to Your children, teach us Your greatness.<br />
									What has been forgotten has not yet been lost."<br /></p>

									<p>Long was his silence, 'fore it was broken.<br />
									"For you, song-weaver, once more I will try.<br />
									To My children venture, carrying wisdom,<br />
									If they but listen, I shall return."<br /></p>
									<p>—Andraste 1:1-1:14</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Andraste 7</span></p>
									<p>Let the blade pass through the flesh,<br />
									Let my blood touch the ground,<br />
									Let my cries touch their hearts. Let mine be the last sacrifice.<br /></p>
									<p>—Andraste 7:12</p>

									<p>Those who oppose thee<br />
									Shall know the wrath of heaven.<br />
									Field and forest shall burn,<br />
									The seas shall rise and devour them,<br />
									The wind shall tear their nations<br />
									From the face of the earth,<br />
									Lightning shall rain down from the sky,<br />
									They shall cry out to their false gods,,<br />
									And find silence.<br /></p>
									<p>—Andraste 7:19</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Andraste 14</span></p>
									<p>Here lies the abyss, the well of all souls.<br />
									From these emerald waters doth life begin anew.<br />
									Come to me, child, and I shall embrace you.<br />
									In my arms lies Eternity.<br /></p>

									<h4>Canticle of Apotheosis</h4>
									<hr>
									
									<p><span class="span-h5">Apotheosis 1</span></p>
									<p><strong>The aftermath of Valerian Fields</strong><br />
									Victory! Sweet song rising from the lips of the vanquishers,<br />
									The host of Shartan, the clans of Alamarri, a thousand freemen<br />
									Held aloft blade and spear and to the Maker gave thanks.<br />
									But for every one who stood and sang the hymn of praise,<br />
									Two lay at their feet, soul seeking the Light eternal.<br /></p>

									<p>Maferath's heart grew cold<br />
									As he looked upon the field of the dead and heard<br />
									The chant of "Glory! Glory! Glory! Hail to the Maker<br />
									Most High! Hail to Andraste, Prophet and liberator,<br />
									Light of the world! Look upon our work, O Maker, and rejoice!"<br /></p>

									<p>And Maferath forsook the celebrations of his people<br />
									And went apart, taking not even his Aegis, his shield-brother.<br />
									In the solitude of the night, Maferath dwelled in his bitterness,<br />
									And the Light which once burned within him extinguished.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Maferath meets with Hessarian</strong><br />
									The lord of the Alamarri sent forth his most trusted runner<br />
									To the gates of Minrathous itself, to call the Archon to parley,<br />
									That like the leaves after a long winter, peace too might return to the land.<br />
									Hessarian was filled to overflowing with doubt that the offer might be true,<br />
									Yet did he reply with message of his own and arrange to meet the war-chief.<br /></p>

									<p>Maferath took with him his Aegis, and arrived at the appointed place<br />
									Where Hessarian waited with his guard, and the two leaders of armies spoke,<br />
									Guarded in riddles, and came to an understanding between them<br />
									That peace bore a heavy price which must be paid in blood.<br /></p>

									<p>And they returned to their own people, and said nothing.</p>

									<p><strong>Andraste prepares to lay siege to Minrathous</strong><br />
									The armies of the Maker marched to the heart of the Imperium.<br />
									They looked upo those gates guarded by the Juggernauts of old<br />
									And despaired, for surely neither army nor god could oppose such might.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste's sermon to the armies</strong><br />
									So Andraste said to her followers: "You who stand before the gates,<br />
									You who have followed me into the heart of evil,<br />
									The fear of death is in your eyes; its hand is upon your throat.<br />
									Raise your voices to the heavens! Remember:<br />
									Not alone do we stand on the field of battle.<br /></p>

									<p>"The Maker is with us! His Light shall be our banner,<br />
									And we shall bear it through the gates of that city and deliver it<br />
									To our brothers and sisters awaiting their freedom within those walls,<br />
									At last, the Light shall shine upon all of creation,<br />
									If we are only strong enough to carry it."<br /></p>

									<p>And the armies of Andraste raised their voices,<br />
									Singing a hymn of praise to the Maker. And feared no more,<br />
									And Andraste went apart to seek the Maker's wisdom<br />
									For the battle to come.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Maferath delivers Andraste to Hessarian</strong><br />
									Maferath went to his wife and said:<br />
									"In the hills lies a silver pool where they say<br />
									The Voice of Heaven can be heard most clearly.<br />
									Let us go together and hear the Maker's Will."<br /></p>

									<p>Andraste went with Maferath and the Aegis to the silver pond.<br />
									As she knelt in prayer, the servants of the Archon surrounded them,<br />
									Spears raised. Andraste drew her sword<br />
									And pierced one man through the heart, but Maferath,<br />
									With a blow from his axe, struck the blade from her hands.<br />
									And it fell to the ground, and where it landed, tears welled from the land.<br /></p>

									<p>The Aegis faltered; his hand could not draw against his own lord,<br />
									But neither could it be stayed as his Prophet was betrayed.<br />
									Unarmed, he stood between Andraste and the Tevinters.<br />
									A spear pierced his chest twice, and he fell.<br /></p>

									<p>With neither blade nor shield, Andraste gave herself up<br />
									To her enemies. And Maferath bound his wife's hands<br />
									And delivered her to the Archon to be put to death.<br /></p>
									<p>—Apotheosis 1:1-1:14</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Apotheosis 2</span></p>
									<p><strong>Andraste is brought forth in chains</strong><br />
									As the sun rose on the army of the faithful,<br />
									The gates of the city parted and the legion descended upon the land<br />
									As the shadow of a distant storm darkens the sun.<br />
									At the forefront of the host rode the Archon himself, sword in hand.<br />
									And at his side, bound by heavy chains, rode the Prophet.<br /></p>

									<p>Hope abandoned the armies of the faithful<br />
									At the sight of their Lady in chains. And a terrible cry<br />
									Rose from the field like the wailing of lost children.<br /></p>

									<p>Before the host of the faithful and all of the Imperium,<br />
									The servants of the Archon assembled a great dais at the feet of the Juggernauts<br />
									And there built a pyre twice the height of a man,<br />
									The Prophet in chains placed on a stake in the center.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>A devoted disciple dies</strong><br />
									The Liberator drew the blade at his side<br />
									And charged the pyre, the freedom of the Prophet before his eyes,<br />
									But from the legion came a storm of arrows<br />
									Blacker than night. And the disciple who had fought side by side<br />
									With the Lady fell, along with a hundred of his People.<br />
									And among the Alamarri ten thousand swords fell to the ground in a chorus of defeat.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste calls out</strong><br />
									The legion doused th pyre around her with lamp oil<br />
									As Andraste called out in a great voice:<br />
									"Maker of the World, forgive them! They have lived too long in shadow<br />
									Without Your Light to guide them! Be with Your children now, O Maker!<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Hessarian lights the pyre</strong><br />
									The Archon stood upon the dais and declared:<br />
									"Today, I end this war!" And by will alone<br />
									Drew fire from air and set the pyre aflame.<br /></p>

									<p>The army of the faithful gathered before the gates of the city<br />
									Wept openly. And from among them voices raised<br />
									In threnody for Andraste wreathed in flame.<br /></p>

									<p>Though the fire enveloped her like a shroud, and the heat from the blaze<br />
									Reached across the field, Andraste was silent and did not cry out.<br />
									And the legionnaires who stood guard nearby<br />
									Were shaken, and began to whisper among themselves:<br />
									"Is she truly the servant of a god?".<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Hessarian begins to doubt</strong><br />
									The Archon looked upon what he had wrought<br />
									As the flames of Andraste's pyre grew ever closer to heaven<br />
									And the heat drove even the bravest of his legion back<br />
									And his heart wavered. For though Andraste did not cry out<br />
									Yet did he see her suffering.<br /></p>

									<p>Merciless, the fire did not spare her mortal flesh.<br />
									And while Hessarian heard over the roar of the bonfire<br />
									The cheering of his magisters, he also heard the distant<br />
									Song of the faithful mourning their Lady.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Hessarian takes pity on Andraste</strong><br />
									Before any among his advisors could draw breath,<br />
									Hessarian took blade to hand and himself<br />
									Dared the fire that consumed the Prophet.<br />
									With one swift strike he pierced her heart.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste dies</strong><br />
									The sky grew dark. And the ground began to tremble as if in mortal dread.<br />
									The crowd before the gates, both Tevinter and faithful, fell silent.<br />
									The heavens wept, and yet no rain could extinguish the flame<br />
									Which was now a funeral pyre. Wind swept across the city<br />
									Like a terrible hand in rage. And the Tevinters who witnessed this<br />
									Said: "Truly, the gods are angered."<br /></p>

									<p>In sorrow, the crowds dispersed. The army of the faithful<br />
									Turned southward, to the lands from which they had come.<br />
									The legion of Tevinter hid inside the walls of their city<br />
									And watched the sky in fear.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Havard returns</strong><br />
									The sky wept as though it would never stop, and the footprints<br />
									Left by armies turned to countless seas, as Andraste's pyre burned to embers<br />
									And grew dark. On hands and knees, wounded unto death,<br />
									Havard, once the Aegis of Maferath, crawled to the feet of his Lady.<br /></p>

									<p>The loyal shield, broken to pieces, found only ash<br />
									Left to the wind and rain. And Havard wept<br />
									And took the ashes, still hot from the fire, and pressed them to his heart.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste appears to Havard</strong><br />
									His ears filled with the song of multitudes<br />
									Raised in chorus, and before his eyes the dark skies parted<br />
									And Andraste, dressed in cloth of starlight and armored<br />
									In moonlight, stood before him, and he was afraid.<br /></p>

									<p>The Lady knelt at his side, saying:<br />
									"Arise, Aegis of the Faith. You are not forgotten.<br />
									Neither man nor Maker shall forget your bravery<br />
									So long as I remember."<br /></p>

									<p>At this, his wounds healed, and he stood<br />
									And gathered up the ashes, and carried them<br />
									To the lands of the Alamarri, away from sorrow forever.<br /></p>
									<p>—Apotheosis 2:1-2:18</p>

									Tooth and claw against blade and bow,<br />
									Until one could no longer be told from the other,<br />
									And cursed them and cursed their generations.<br /></p>

									<p>And those who slept, the ancient ones, awoke,<br />
									For their dreams had been devoured<br />
									By a demon that prowled the Fade<br />
									As a wolf hunts a herd of deer.<br />
									Taking first the weakest and frailest of hopes,<br />
									And when there was nothing left,<br />
									Destroying the bright and bold<br />
									By subtlety and ambush and cruel arts.<br /></p>

									<p>The ninth sacred mountain upon which rests<br />
									The mortal dust of Our Lady ascended<br />
									Whole into the heavens, to be given high honor<br />
									In the Realm of Dreams forever.<br />
									And around it, a chorus of spirits sang:<br />
									"Whatsoever passes through the fire<br />
									Is not lost, but made eternal;<br />
									As air can never be broken nor crushed,<br />
									The tempered soul is everlasting!"<br /></p>

									<p>And I looked up and saw<br />
									The seven gates of the Black City shatter,<br />
									And darkness cloaked both realms.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste gives Drakon his destiny</strong><br />
									I covered my face, fearful,<br />
									But the Lady took my hands from my eyes,<br />
									Saying, "Remember the fire. You must pass<br />
									Through it alone to be forged anew.<br />
									Look! Look upon the Light so you<br />
									May lead others here through the darkness,<br />
									Blade of the Faith!"<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Maker returns</strong><br />
									In dread I looked up once more<br />
									And saw the darkness warp and crumble,<br />
									For it was thin as samite,<br />
									A fragile shroud over the Light<br />
									Which turned it to ash.<br /></p>

									<p>And the Maker, clad in the majesty of the sky,<br />
									Set foot to earth, and at His touch<br />
									All warring ceased. The vicious<br />
									Beasts lay down and were quieted;<br />
									The meek lambs became bold<br />
									And rose up, casting aside their shepherds<br />
									To dance at the Maker's feet.<br /></p>

									<p>From every corner of the earth<br />
									The Chant of Light echoed,<br />
									And the Maker walked the land<br />
									With Andraste at His right hand.<br />
									And they reached the gates of Minrathous,<br />
									Where once a terrible fire swept<br />
									The Light of redemption from the face of the world,<br />
									And there, the Lady of Restitution<br />
									Drew her shining sword<br />
									And plunged it into the ground at her feet, saying:<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The sins of creation are redeemed</strong><br />
									"All sins are forgiven! All crimes pardoned!<br />
									Let no soul harbor guilt!<br />
									Let no soul hunger for justice!<br />
									By the Maker's will I decree<br />
									Harmony in all things.<br />
									Let Balance be restored<br />
									And the world given eternal life."<br /></p>

									<h4>Canticle of Shartan</h4>
									<hr>
									
									<p><span class="span-h5">Shartan 9</span></p>
									<p><strong>The rebel slaves flee</strong><br />
									For twenty days and twenty nights the People ran,<br />
									With the footsteps of the legion ever at their backs.<br />
									No rest could they find, since their flight from Vol Dorma.<br /></p>


									<p>The People cried out in despair:<br />
									"Alas, that we ever left Vol Dorma!<br />
									Better we had died there than to be hunted like sport on the plains."<br /></p>

									<p>Among the People, some began to whisper of returning<br />
									To the city and throwing themselves<br />
									At the feet of their former masters,<br />
									And Shartan heard them.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Shartan rallies the elves</strong><br />
									As the People paused to break bread at the foot<br />
									Of the hill the Tevinters called "the Lonely One,"<br />
									Shartan stood on the hilltop and spoke, saying:<br />
									"Some among you wish to flee back to your masters,<br />
									To throw yourselves at their feet and ask forgiveness.<br />
									You have left that path. It is already gone.<br />
									Your feet can never again tread the dust of Vol Dorma.<br /></p>

									<p>"He who asks for the mercy of the masters<br />
									Will stand accountable for murder and theft<br />
									And be made example for the slaves of other cities,<br />
									That they might not have the courage to rise up.<br /></p>

									<p>"They will taunt you and humiliate you<br />
									While they hang you in the marketplace.<br />
									They will pelt you with offal while they call you<br />
									Broken, a coward, and a failure.<br /></p>

									<p>"A dog might slink back to the hand it has bitten<br />
									And be forgiven, but a slave never.<br />
									If you would live, and live without fear, you must fight."<br /></p>

									<p>And the People heard the truth in Shartan's voice,<br />
									And some cursed themselves and their fate and despaired.<br />
									And others began to fashion spears and bows<br />
									From the branches of trees, and girded themselves<br />
									With bark and scraps torn from their sandals<br />
									And dug pits in the earth with their hands.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The elves ambush the legion</strong><br />
									Darkness fell upon the Lonely One,<br />
									A night without moon or stars,<br />
									As the legion followed, like bloodhounds,<br />
									The trail of the rebels.<br /></p>

									<p>And when the hunters reached the foot<br />
									Of the solitary hill, they found nothing,<br />
									The trail of their quarry vanished, as if the People<br />
									Had taken wing.<br /></p>

									<p>The officers began to curse their men<br />
									And blame one another for losing the trail,<br />
									And the soldiers fell to bickering among themselves.<br /></p>

									<p>In silence all around them, the People crept out<br />
									From holes clawed in the earth, and with harvesting blades<br />
									And arrows chipped from stones,<br />
									Fell upon the unwary legion and slaughtered them to a man.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The elves celebrate their victory</strong><br />
									And the People raised the blades of the fallen soldiers to the heavens<br />
									And rejoiced. And Shartan said to them:<br />
									"No longer are we hunted! We shall never again<br />
									Be prey, waiting to be struck down!<br />
									Let us take up the blades of our enemies<br />
									And carve a place for ourselves in this world!"<br /></p>

									<p>The People heard him, and girded themselves<br />
									In the armor of the dead<br />
									And sharpened ther blades and arrows<br />
									And prepared for war.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The army of Andraste arrives</strong><br />
									As the People danced over the corpses<br />
									Of slain soldiers, a thunder filled the air<br />
									And the ground trembled, and a hush fell over them,<br />
									As they knew a terrible omen had come.<br /></p>

									<p>From afar, they heard the sound<br />
									Of ten thousand voices raised in song,<br />
									And the marching of a great host.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Shartan goes forth to meet the army</strong><br />
									Seeing an army beyond counting gathered in the distance,<br />
									Shartan said to the People<br />
									"Let us not fall into the jaws of the wolf together.<br />
									I will go alone and see what army comes,<br />
									Singing, to the land of Tevinter."<br /></p>

									<p>Across the empty plains Shartan crept<br />
									To where the great host camped, the light from countless fires<br />
									Guiding him through the darkness.<br /></p>

									<p>Then a great hand clamped down upon Shartan's neck,<br />
									And he was lifted into the air. And he looked into the eyes<br />
									Of a towering creature, taller than any legion soldier, featured like a man<br />
									But covered in fur like a beast and bearing a mighty shield.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Havard the Aegis greets Shartan</strong><br />
									The creature spoke in a stern voice, saying:<br />
									"Why are you to come upon us alone,<br />
									Wearing the armor of our most hated foe,<br />
									When I can see you are no man of the legion?"<br />
									And Shartan answered him: "If you hate the legion,<br />
									Then I am your friend."<br /></p>

									<p>And the giant laughed, and set him back upon his feet,<br />
									Declaring: "Then the Aegis of Alamarri bids you welcome!<br />
									Follow me to the side of the Prophet."<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Shartan meets Andraste</strong><br />
									The Aegis led him to the center of the great host,<br />
									And Shartan saw that they counted men and women of all descriptions among them.<br />
									Many bore the scars of escaped slaves, and some had come west<br />
									From the coastlands, and they stood as equals beside the wild giant men of the South.<br /></p>

									<p>There, in the heart of them, sang a Lady radiant<br />
									And clad in armor of bright steel.<br />
									She paused her song to look upon Shartan,<br />
									And said to him: "All souls who take up the sword<br />
									Against Tevinter are welcome here.<br />
									Rest, and tell us of your battles."<br /></p>

									<p>And Shartan told her: "I cannot rest<br />
									While the People wait in darkness and fear."<br />
									So Andraste sent him with three of her attendants<br />
									To invite the People to come to her side.<br /></p>

									<p>And the People came, all astonished<br />
									To stand among Andraste's followers,<br />
									And she gave them food and drink and bade them sit<br />
									While Shartan gave her the tale of their uprising<br />
									And flight from Val Dorma.<br /></p>

									<p>When the tale was finished, Andraste said to Shartan:<br />
									"Truly, the Maker has called you, just as He called me,<br />
									To be a Light for your People.<br />
									The host you see before you march,<br />
									Bearing His will north, where we shall deliver it<br />
									To Minrathous city of magisters, and we shall tear down<br />
									The unassailable gates, and set all slaves free."<br /></p>

									<p>And Shartan looked upon the Prophet Andraste<br />
									And said: "The People will set ourselves free.<br />
									Your host from the South may march<br />
									Alongside us.<br /></p>

									<p>The giants of the South rose to their feet as one<br />
									And bowed. And Andraste said:<br />
									"It is done. We march as one."<br /></p>
									<p>—Shartan 9:1-9:28, Dissonant Verse</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Shartan 10</span></p>
									<p><strong>The armies clash on Valerian Fields</strong><br /><p>
									
									<p>At Shartan's word, the sky<br />
									Grew black with arrows.<br />
									At Our Lady's, ten thousand swords<br />
									Rang from their sheaths.<br />
									A great hymn rose over Valarian Fields gladly, proclaiming:<br />
									Those who had been slaves were now free.<br /></p>

									<p>The legion fell before them<br />
									Like wheat before the scythe,<br />
									But the armies of Tevinter were numberless,<br />
									A sea of death which crashed upon<br />
									The Prophet and her army like waves.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Shartan rescues Andraste</strong><br />
									The host of the Lady<br />
									Began to falter. The legion<br />
									Turned spear and sword, fire<br />
									And ice upon them, and the warriors<br />
									Of the Prophet were scattered,<br />
									Divided from their commanders<br />
									By magic, penned like cattle for slaughter.<br /></p>

									<p>Shartan saw that walls of ice<br />
									Surrounded Andraste and her warriors,<br />
									And he rallied the People.<br />
									And with arrows aflame,<br />
									The walls of magic melted<br />
									And the Prophet and her warriors were free.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste names Shartan her champion</strong><br />
									And the Prophet stood beside Shartan<br />
									And shouted to her host:<br />
									"Behold! Our champion!"<br />
									And gave to him the blade of her own mother<br />
									From her own scabbard, Glandivalis, saying:<br /></p>

									<p>"Take this, my champion,<br />
									And free our people forever."<br />
									And the Prophet and the People<br />
									Struck down the mages of the legion<br />
									And claimed the field together.<br /></p>

									<p>And before them, empty,<br />
									Outstretched lay the land<br />
									Which led to the gates of Minrathous.<br /></p>

									<h4>Canticle of Silence</h4>
									<hr>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Silence 1</span></p>

									<p><strong>The Choir of Silence is corrupted</strong><br />
									First among the Old Gods was Silence.<br />
									His least whisper could end wars or topple Archons.<br />
									A single word could turn recrimination into glory.<br />
									The sacred fires of his temple burned<br />
									Rare incense, and the trees of Arlathan, and lapped at the bones of slaves<br />
									While his altars dripped with the blood of sacrifices that never dried.<br /></p>

									<p>The High Priest, Conductor of the Choir of Silence, ruled<br />
									Above all the Dreamers of the Imperium. Wisest<br />
									And most powerful of the Magisters Sidereal.<br />
									In his dreams, he alone heard the voice of Silence.<br /></p>
									
									<p>"Open the gates.<br />
									To my Golden City you must sojourn.<br />
									At the foot of my throne, I shall anoint you,<br />
									Most favored of my disciples,<br />
									And I shall raise you up to godhood<br />
									That all mortals shall know your glory."<br /></p>

									<p>The call of the Old God filled the High Priest's heart,<br />
									Consuming all his waking hours and turning his dreams<br />
									To ash and bones.Every priest and acolyte of Silence<br />
									To the Great Choir assembled, and the High Priest<br />
									Shared with them the words of Silence..<br /></p>

									<p>Every priest and acolyte of the Choir<br />
									Turned their hearts and minds as one to<br />
									Their god's command. For the Word of Silence<br />
									Could not be ignored, and the fire burning<br />
									In the heart of the High Priest consumed them<br />
									As a wildfire consumes plains.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The priests formulate a plan</strong><br />
									All knew the Golden Heart of dreams' kingdom<br />
									Shone like a star, forever out of reach.<br />
									No mortal foot could tread those halls,<br />
									No hand knocked upon the gate.<br />
									Secrets beyond measure were the keys<br />
									The Choir of Silence would need, and they had few.<br /></p>

									<p>And so the First Acolyte spoke to the High Priest<br />
									And said: "We are the masters of secrets,<br />
									But our god demands more. Let us to the Builders<br />
									Whisper, and they who construct monuments to the glory<br />
									of the gods shall build us a road to the Golden City,<br />
									Where your promise shall be fulfilled."<br /></p>

									<p>And the Great Conductor of the Choir heard him.</p>

									<p><strong>The priests of Beauty are corrupted</strong><br />
									The High Priest of Beauty, Architect of the Works of Beauty, designed<br />
									Every work and wonder of the Imperium according to the plans of his god.<br />
									To him, the Conductor went in secret, armed<br />
									With the whisper of Silence.<br /></p>

									<p>But the High Priest of Beauty was sorely troubled,<br />
									For he served only the Great Plans<br />
									And would in no wise raise a servant of Silence<br />
									Above himself or his god.<br /></p>

									<p>And yet, the fire in the Conductor's heart ignited<br />
									Within the Architect a terrible flame.<br />
									And so he turned all the lesser priests and acolytes from the Temple of Beauty<br />
									To beseech counsel from his god.<br /></p>

									<p>And to him, Beauty revealed a grand plan:<br />
									"Open the gates.<br />
									And when you stand before me,<br />
									I shall give you designs<br />
									That shall rival the greatness of heaven.<br />
									I will make you the First among the new gods,<br />
									And you will build a paradise on earth."<br /></p>

									<p>So the High Priest of Beauty returned to the Conductor of Silence<br />
									And promised all the skill of Beauty's designs<br />
									In reaching the Golden City.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The remainder of the priesthoods are recruited</strong><br />
									But the designs of Beauty's High Priest demanded more.<br />
									No small sacrifice would open the gate.<br />
									And so the High Priest of Silence went forth again.<br />
									To the Watchman of Night, and the Forgewright of Fire,<br />
									To the Appraiser of Slavery, and the Augur of Mystery,<br />
									And last of all to the Madman of Chaos.<br />
									The words of Silence were revealed.<br /></p>

									<p>Jealousy and torment consumed them all, for no dreamer<br />
									Wished to aid the others in the least measure,<br />
									Yet none could bear that rivals might walk in the Light<br />
									Of their gods, when they did not.<br /></p>

									<p>So each retired to their temples and sought wisdom<br />
									From the voice of their own god. And each god<br />
									Gave the same commandment:<br />
									The unreachable gate must open.<br />
									And each was promised<br />
									Power and glory beyond all reckoning<br />
									If they would only come to the feet of the gods and ask.<br /></p>

									<p>And so they joined in secret, telling none<br />
									Who were not of the temples of their designs.<br />
									And in Minrathous, in the heart of the Archon a sliver of fear grew,<br />
									Stabbing like a wound. Though he knew not why.<br /></p>
									<p>—Silence 1:1-1:17, Dissonant Verse</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Silence 2</span></p>

									<p><strong>The seven High Priests prepare</strong><br />
									The Imperium slept. In the lofty palaces<br />
									Mages dreamed of the Maker's Palace, golden and shining,<br />
									And though they knew not why, the dream turned their blood to ice.<br />
									Soldiers stood their watches, and servants hurried on errands,<br />
									Unaware of what the dawn would bring.<br /></p>

									<p>In the Great Choir of Silence, the High Priests gathered.<br />
									A hundred chosen acolytes brought lyrium<br />
									Enough to drown a city in chiming silver<br />
									And slaves beyond counting to the temple<br />
									In accordance with the designs of their gods.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Someone speaks out against the plan</strong><br />
									As he looked upon the waiting sacrifices,<br />
									One acolyte felt the first prickling pangs<br />
									Of dread. And he turned to his fellow priests,<br />
									Saying: "Should glory come at such a price?<br />
									What reward can be worth this? If mortals<br />
									Were meant to stand among the gods,<br />
									Would the gods not open their gates to us?<br />
									Rather than demand we build a tower,<br />
									Blood, bone, and metal, to the heavens?"<br /></p>
									
									<p><strong>The ritual begins</strong><br />
									But the gathered acolytes turned from him,<br />
									For there was nothing but ambition<br />
									Where hearts once beat within them.<br />
									And ninety-nine knives gleamed in the firelight<br />
									As the sacrifices began.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The doubting acolyte flees</strong><br />
									The one who had spoken<br />
									Into shadow crept and made himself away.<br />
									North, to the road, Minrathous bound.<br />
									Fear grasping at his every breath<br />
									That none might stop his brethren<br />
									Save the Archon himself.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Magisters ascend</strong><br />
									The Great Choir of Silence shook<br />
									As the earth trembled in holy terror.<br />
									A wordless scream is if from<br />
									The legions of dead slaves rose<br />
									To the zenith of the black sky.<br /></p>

									<p>Before the might of the seven Magisters Sidereal,<br />
									The Veil shattered like the flimsiest glass.<br />
									Dream and waking lay before their feet,<br />
									Two paths diverging.<br />
									Into the dream they strode, dauntless,<br />
									For nothing in the realm of gods or man<br />
									Could keep them from their promised prize.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Magisters enter the Golden City</strong><br />
									The minds of all lay bare before the Seven,<br />
									But no mere machinations against the sleeping<br />
									Had brought them hence.<br />
									By blood and lyrium were they drawn<br />
									Inexorably to the Unreachable City,<br />
									The heart of all creation.<br /></p>

									<p>At a touch, the gate swung wide,<br />
									And the Light parted before them like a curtain<br />
									Swept aside by nothing. Fearful to touch them.<br />
									And none saw the black mark<br />
									Spreading like a sore upon the shining gate<br />
									Where mortal hand had lain.<br /></p>
									<p>—Silence 2:1-2:9, Dissonant Verse</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Silence 3</span></p>

									<p><strong>The Magisters face judgment</strong><br />
									Surrounded by glory, the Seven stood,<br />
									In the hall of apotheosis, heedless<br />
									Of what festered in the shadows the cast there,<br />
									Of what stained and corroded footprints they left.<br /></p>

									<p>But upon the throne of heaven they found<br />
									No dragons bearing promised rewards<br />
									But the Maker of the World in all His radiance,<br />
									And the Seven cried out in shock and rage, for nothing<br />
									They had seen in vision or imagined in their most<br />
									Avaricious dreams had prepared them to see<br />
									His Light with mortal eyes.<br /></p>

									<p>Like moths who reach a bonfire, the Seven burned.<br />
									But the Maker kept them from death,<br />
									And He held the priests before His throne<br />
									And looked upon them, His long-awaited children<br />
									At last returned to Him. And He saw<br />
									Only hunger and envy in their hearts,<br />
									Only pride and desire in their eyes,<br />
									And He knew that they knew Him not.<br /></p>

									<p>Then the Maker heard the distant cries<br />
									Of the sacrificed. A chorus of voices beyond counting<br />
									Calling out for justice. And all that they had done<br />
									Was known to Him.<br /></p>

									<p>The Maker of All spoke to the Seven then, saying:<br />
									"Into My house you walk uninvited, demanding rewards<br />
									You have not earned. On wings of death<br />
									And suffering are you borne hence.<br />
									The darkness planted by your betrayers in your hearts I see.<br />
									Did you not know, when you chose to revere them over Me?<br /></p>

									<p>"The Old Gods will call to you,<br />
									From their ancient prisons they will sing.<br />
									Dragons with wicked eyes and wicked hearts,<br />
									On blacken'd wings does deceit take flight,<br />
									The first of My children, lost to night.<br /></p>

									<p>"You have chosen, and spilled the blood<br />
									Of innocence for power. I pity your folly,<br />
									But still more do I pity those whose lives you have taken<br />
									In pursuit of selfish goals.<br />
									No more will you bear the Light.<br />
									To darkness flee, and be gone from My sight!"<br /></p>

									<p>And the Veil ripped beneath their feet,<br />
									And the Seven fell. And the gates of the city slammed<br />
									Shut. And the wicked corruption they had carried<br />
									Covered it. And it opened no more.<br />
									And the Maker in sorrow turned His gaze<br />
									And no longer hoped for His children to return.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The alarm is raised in Minrathous</strong><br />
									The great city of Minrathous<br />
									The faithful acolyte had through desperate measures reached.<br />
									His heart like ice, certain that none<br />
									Save the Archon alone could hold back<br />
									Those wheels the high priests and their lackeys<br />
									Had set in motion.<br /></p>

									<p>No more did the Old Gods whisper in his ear.<br />
									No more did he hear any voice in his dreams<br />
									But his own, and the mutterings of jealous spirits,<br />
									And he knew that this silence boded ill.<br /></p>

									<p>No mere acolyte could approach<br />
									The throne of the Ferryman.<br />
									Stave and spear blocked his path<br />
									And the faithful acolyte feared that all was lost.<br /></p>

									<p>But guided by wisdom and portent both,<br />
									The Archon bade his guard stand aside,<br />
									And the lowly priest brought before him,<br />
									That he might know the meaning<br />
									Behind the holy dread which shadowed his every step.<br /></p>

									<p>The design of the priests was laid bare,<br />
									And the Archon turned with steel resolve<br />
									To his appointed task.<br />
									For only divine wrath could follow<br />
									Where the traitorous Seven had gone.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Magisters fall</strong><br />
									The Seven fell from the Wellspring of Creation,<br />
									No longer creatures of the Maker's Light.<br />
									From the height of heaven they plunged,<br />
									And Tevinter saw them burn across the sky like falling stars.<br />
									Where they touched the earth,<br />
									Twisted darkness grew, poisoned by their hate.<br />
									And the clouds covered them and wept.<br /></p>

									<p>Like a sickness, evil grew within them.<br />
									Their pride refused all measure of blame.<br />
									Not they, but their masters had brought them low.<br />
									They cried out in rage to gods<br />
									Who did not answer.<br />
									And they would have vengeance upon<br />
									The gods of broken promises.<br />
									And through them, vengeance<br />
									On the Maker and His world.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Archon scatters the Magisters</strong><br />
									<p>The Archon followed the path of fire<br />
									Writ large across the sky of Tevinter,<br />
									And upon the plain where once great<br />
									Barindur had stood he arrived,<br />
									Girded in lyrium and silverite,<br />
									Bearing in his left hand<br />
									A staff of gold and emeralds, wreathed in lightning,<br />
									And upon his right<br />
									The ring of the Ferryman, symbol of Darinius<br />
									And the Might of the Imperium itself.<br /></p>

									<p>The Seven struck against the Archon<br />
									With all their twisted magic,<br />
									But no pestilent hate could turn aside<br />
									Tevinter's Ferryman.<br /></p>

									<p>Across the plain, the Archon saw,<br />
									Where the defilers stood, corruption,<br />
									Blackness all consuming,<br />
									Threatened to engulf his land and all his people.<br />
									With fire and lightning he strove<br />
									To cleanse the spreading poison from the earth,<br />
									To no avail. Magic could not undo<br />
									What evil had done.<br /></p>

									<p>So the Archon called upon the spirits of the Fade,<br />
									And adding their strength to his own,<br />
									Scattered them to the winds and the corners of the earth<br />
									And with a heavy heart<br />
									Returned to unassailable Minrathous<br />
									To prepare his people for the doom to come.<br /></p>

									<p>From the waters of the Fade you made the world.<br />
									As the Fade had been fluid, so was the world fixed.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 1:4</p>

									<p>And so we burned. We raised nations, we waged wars,<br />
									We dreamed up false gods, great demons<br />
									Who could cross the Veil into the waking world,<br />
									Turned our devotion upon them, and forgot you.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 1:8</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Threnodies 5</span></p>

									<p><strong>The Maker creates the Fade and the spirits</strong><br />
									<p>There was no word<br />
									For heaven or for earth, for sea or sky.<br />
									All that existed was silence.<br />
									Then the Voice of the Maker rang out,<br />
									The first Word,<br />
									And His Word became all that might be:<br />
									Dream and idea, hope and fear,<br />
									Endless possibilities.<br />
									And from it made his firstborn.<br />
									And he said to them:<br />
									"In My image I forge you,<br />
									To you I give dominion<br />
									Over all that exists.<br />
									By your will<br />
									May all things be done."<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Golden City</strong><br />
									<p>Then in the center of heaven<br />
									He called forth<br />
									A city with towers of gold,<br />
									streets with music for cobblestones,<br />
									And banners which flew without wind.<br />
									There, He dwelled, waiting<br />
									To see the wonders<br />
									His children would create.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Maker becomes disillusioned with the spirits</strong><br />
									<p>The children of the Maker gathered<br />
									Before his golden throne<br />
									And sang hymns of praise unending.<br />
									But their songs<br />
									Were the songs of the cobblestones.<br />
									They shone with the golden light<br />
									Reflected from the Maker's throne.<br />
									They held forth the banners<br />
									That flew on their own.<br /></p>

									<p>And the Voice of the Maker shook the Fade<br />
									Saying: In My image I have wrought<br />
									My firstborn. You have been given dominion<br />
									Over all that exists. By your will<br />
									All things are done.<br />
									Yet you do nothing.<br />
									The realm I have given you<br />
									Is formless, ever-changing.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Fade is separated from the World</strong><br />
									<p>And He knew He had wrought amiss.<br />
									So the Maker turned from his firstborn<br />
									And took from the Fade<br />
									A measure of its living flesh<br />
									And placed it apart from the Spirits, and spoke to it, saying:<br />
									Here, I decree<br />
									Opposition in all things:<br />
									For earth, sky<br />
									For winter, summer<br />
									For darkness, Light.<br />
									By My Will alone is Balance sundered<br />
									And the world given new life.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Man is created</strong><br />
									<p>And no longer was it formless, ever-changing,<br />
									But held fast, immutable,<br />
									With Words for heaven and for earth, sea and sky.<br />
									At last did the Maker<br />
									From the living world<br />
									Make men. Immutable, as the substance of the earth,<br />
									With souls made of dream and idea, hope and fear,<br />
									Endless possibilities.<br /></p>

									<p>Then the Maker said:<br />
									"To you, My second-born, I grant this gift:<br />
									In your heart shall burn<br />
									An unquenchable flame<br />
									All-consuming, and never satisfied.<br />
									From the Fade I crafted you,<br />
									And to the Fade you shall return<br />
									Each night in dreams<br />
									That you may always remember Me."<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The Maker seals himself in the Golden City</strong><br />
									<p>And then the Maker sealed the gates<br />
									Of the Golden City<br />
									And there, He dwelled, waiting<br />
									To see the wonders<br />
									His children would create.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 5:1-5:8</p>

									<p><strong>The rise of the Old Gods</strong><br />
									<p>Now, with their Father's eye elsewhere, the firstborn<br />
									At last created something new:<br />
									Envy. They looked upon the living world and the favored<br />
									Sons and daughters there, covetous of all they were.<br />
									Within their hearts grew<br />
									An intolerable hunger.<br />
									Until, at last, some of the firstborn said:<br />
									"Our Father has abandoned us for these lesser things.<br />
									We have power over heaven.<br />
									Let us rule over earth as well<br />
									And become greater gods than our Father."<br /></p>

									<p>The demons appeared to the children of earth in dreams<br />
									And named themselves gods, demanding fealty.<br />
									And a mighty voice cried out,<br />
									Shaking the very foundations of heaven:<br />
									"Ungrateful children! I gave you power<br />
									To shape heaven itself,<br />
									And you have made only poison.<br />
									As you crave the earth, the earth shall be<br />
									Your domain! Into the darkness<br />
									I cast you! In tombs of immutable rock<br />
									Shall you dwell for all time."<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 5:9-5:10</p>

									<p>Those who had been cast down,<br />
									The demons who would be gods,<br />
									Began to whisper to men from their tombs within the earth.<br />
									And the men of Tevinter heard and raised altars<br />
									To the pretender-gods once more,<br />
									And in return were given, in hushed whispers,<br />
									The secrets of darkest magic.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 5:11</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Threnodies 6</span></p>

									<p><strong>War between Neromenian and Inghirsh</strong><br />
									<p>On the shores of the Nocen, in the lands of Neromenian<br />
									King Antoridus girded his people for war. A thousand strong<br />
									Carried spear and bow to the East. To be forged anew<br />
									And rise on burning wings, heroes of Neromenian.<br />
									Mighty were the Inghirsh, who returned numbers beyond counting<br />
									To the lands of their fathers, carried on the shields of their kin.<br /></p>

									<p>Antonidus demanded victory, and so his many Oracles<br />
									Consulted the stars and drank the blood of unclean beasts,<br />
									Seeking counsel from the Maker that they might deliver<br />
									To their king the lands of the Inghirsh people.<br />
									And the Maker gave them signs and portents<br />
									That no victory was theirs to claim.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The First Dreamer</strong><br />
									<p>But among the king's Oracles was one, Thalsian, who sought counsel<br />
									Not from the Maker of the World, but from a demon of the Fade.<br />
									And he returned to his king with its tidings.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Antoridus turns away from the Maker</strong><br />
									<p>If Antoridus would make burned offerings of oxen and horses<br />
									And swear that he would follow the Maker no more,<br />
									The demon would grant him the lands of all the Inghirsh people.<br />
									So Antoridus sought the best oxen and horses<br />
									And made burned offerings to the demon. And he turned his back<br />
									Upon the Maker of the World.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Conquest of the Inghirsh</strong><br />
									<p>So did the demon gift to Antonidus victory<br />
									Over the mighty Inghirsh, and they who had held forth<br />
									Against ten thousand spears were laid low<br />
									And their people were made chattel, and their lands claimed<br />
									In the name of Neromenian.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>War with the Planasene</strong><br />
									<p>The power of Neromenian grew sevenfold.<br />
									And with it, Antoridus's heart grew hard. And he looked<br />
									Upon the lands of the Planasene to the south, and said:<br />
									"There upon the plains I see a land of plenty.<br />
									The branches bear fruit until they bow to the ground,<br />
									And sheaves of wheat go to rot, forgotten, in the fields."<br /></p>

									<p>So once again, in the lands of King Antoridus<br />
									The people of Neromenian girded for war. Seven thousand strong<br />
									Carried spear and bow to the South. To forge anew<br />
									The land of plenty in the name of the king.<br /></p>

									<p>In the lands of the South, on the banks<br />
									Of the River Pnemoix, the people heard the croaking of ravens<br />
									And were afraid. They cried out to their king, Damertes,<br />
									To save them from the coming storm.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Damertes consults his Oracles</strong><br />
									<p>The king of the Planasene, sorely troubled,<br />
									From amongst the wisest of his people gathered<br />
									A council to prepare for the arrival of the enemy.<br />
									And the sages went forth and looked to the stars,<br />
									Drew water from the sacred River Pnemoix,<br />
									With hope that the fate of Inghirsh might not be shared.<br /></p>

									<p>And the Great Blade of Heaven revealed<br />
									An attack would come in secret, from the East.<br />
									And the Swift carried with it news that the men of the North<br />
									Would set the fields of Planasene alight before them.<br /></p>

									<p>And lo, the sages returned to their King Damertes<br />
									And girded the warriors of Planasene with talismans<br />
									Carved from serpentstone and anointed their brows<br />
									With the waters of the sacred Pnemoix,<br />
									And sent them forth to battle with Neromenian.<br /></p>

									<p>Damertes decreed that all the men and women of the kingdom<br />
									To the fields of the East journey with vessels drawn<br />
									From the Sacred Pnemoix. And for three days and three nights<br />
									They anointed the fields that the river's blessing<br />
									Might keep the fires of the dragons' children at bay.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>The armies clash</strong><br />
									<p>On the eve of battle, the armies of Antoridus raised their voices<br />
									In praise to their demon gods for their victory to come,<br />
									While the armies of Damertes called out in supplication to the Maker.<br />
									No darkness could hide the fears of Planasene,<br />
									No star could outshine the sureness of Neromenian.<br /></p>

									<p>As the sun rose, the armies girded themselves,<br />
									And the dragons' children put flame to the fields of Planasene,<br />
									But the sacred Pnemoix protected them, and they did not burn.<br /></p>

									<p>The army of Antoridus, seven thousand strong, raised their bows<br />
									And a terrible thunder rang out, and the sky went black with arrows,<br />
									And though they raised their shields, a rain of death fell<br />
									Upon the Planasene, whose blood anointed the fields.<br /></p>

									<p>A mighty cry of rage went up from the army of Damertes<br />
									To see their brothers and sisters struck down.<br />
									And the army of Antoridus answered<br />
									With the thunder of spears beating shields.<br /></p>

									<p>And the soldiers of the demon charged,<br />
									Spears thirsting for the blood of the Maker's children.<br />
									And the army of Damertes readied their shields.<br /></p>

									<p>The righteous stood before the armies<br />
									As a boulder stands before a tide:<br />
									Unshaken, rooted there by the Maker's Hand.<br />
									And the demon's soldiers broke upon their shields<br />
									As a wave breaks upon the shore.<br /></p>

									<p>As the sun set upon the fields of Planasene,<br />
									The armies of Neromenian had taken no steps into the lands of the faithful.<br />
									But the fields ran red. And great were the lamentations of the living<br />
									For the countless dead of Damertes.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Damertes forsakes the Maker</strong><br />
									<p>In the deep hours of the night, King Damertes sought<br />
									Counsel from his sages, for he knew<br />
									His army could not withstand another day against the dragons' children.<br />
									And the wisest sages of Planasene consulted the stars<br />
									And found nothing.<br /></p>

									<p>In desperation, King Damertes turned<br />
									To pagan soothsayers, saying:<br />
									"Find me a demon with the strength to counter Neromenian's."<br />
									And they reached into the darkest realms of dream<br />
									And found one who promised Damertes<br />
									To turn aside the spears of Antoridus<br />
									If he would forsake the Maker and praise only her name.<br /></p>

									<p>So, in the hours before dawn, King Damertes cursed the Maker's name.<br />
									And he burned offerings to the demon, and praised her<br />
									That his lands might be spared.<br /></p>

									<p>And as the sun rose upon the fields of the Planasene,<br />
									The armies of Antoridus fell to the ground<br />
									Afflicted with boils and racked with pain.<br />
									And they cried out in fear, and fled back to their own lands.<br />
									And from that day forth, the Maker's name was spoken no more<br />
									In the lands of the sacred Pnemoix.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 6:1-6:23</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Threnodies 7</span></p>

									<p>And as the black clouds came upon them,<br />
									They looked on what pride had wrought,<br />
									And despaired.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 7:10</p>

									<p>The work of man and woman,<br />
									By hubris of their making.<br />
									The sorrow a blight unbearable.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 7:11</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Threnodies 8</span></p>

									<p>The numbering of Threnodies 8 is hard to understand, as there are various sources of quotes from its verses<br />
									that don't seem to quite form a coherent picture. See references for more information<br /></p>

									<p>No matter their power, their triumphs,<br />
									The mage-lords of Tevinter were men<br />
									And doomed to die.<br />
									Then a voice whispered within their hearts,<br />
									Shall you surrender your power<br />
									To time like the beasts of the fields?<br />
									You are the Lords of the earth!<br />
									Go forth to claim the empty throne<br />
									Of Heaven and be gods.<br /></p>

									<p>In secret they worked<br />
									Magic upon magic<br />
									All their power and all their vanity<br />
									They turned against the Veil<br />
									Until at last, it gave way.<br /></p>

									<p>Above them, a river of Light,<br />
									Before them the throne of Heaven, waiting,<br />
									Beneath their feet<br />
									The footprints of the Maker,<br />
									And all around them echoed a vast<br />
									Silence.<br /></p>

									<p>But when they took a single step<br />
									Toward the empty throne<br />
									A great voice cried out<br />
									Shaking the very foundations<br />
									Of Heaven and earth:<br /></p>

									<p>And So is the Golden City blackened<br />
									With each step you take in my Hall.<br />
									Marvel at perfection, for it is fleeting.<br />
									You have brought Sin to Heaven<br />
									And doom upon all the world.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8.13</p>

									<p>Violently were they cast down,<br />
									For no mortal may walk bodily<br />
									In the realm of dreams,<br />
									Bearing the mark of their Crime:<br />
									Bodies so maimed<br />
									And distorted that none should see them<br />
									And know them for men.<br /></p>

									<p>Deep into the earth they fled,<br />
									Away from the Light.<br />
									In Darkness eternal they searched<br />
									For those who had goaded them on,<br />
									Until at last they found their prize,<br />
									Their god, their betrayer:<br />
									The sleeping dragon Dumat. Their taint<br />
									Twisted even the false-god, and the whisperer<br />
									Awoke at last, in pain and horror, and led<br />
									Them to wreak havoc upon all the nations of the world:<br />
									The first Blight.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8.7</p>

									<p>In the absence of light, shadows thrive</p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8:21</p>

									<p>There in the depths of the earth they dwelled,<br />
									Spreading their taint as a plague, growing in number<br />
									Until they were a multitude.<br />
									And together they searched ever deeper<br />
									Until they found their prize,<br />
									Their god, their betrayer.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8:27</p>

									<p>And down they fled into darkness and despair.</p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8:28</p>

									<p>Those who had been cast down,<br />
									the demons who would be gods,<br />
									began to whisper to men from their tombs within the earth.<br />
									And the men of Tevinter heard,<br />
									and raised altars to the pretender gods once more,<br />
									and in return were given, in hushed whispers,<br />
									the secrets of darkest magic.<br /></p>

									<p>But it was not worship the false gods craved.</p>

									<p>They urged the magisters to ever-greater depravity,<br />
									rewarding them with power and more.<br />
									Arrogance became a great caged beast in the lands of Tevinter,<br />
									an emptiness that consumed all and could never be filled.<br />
									To satisfy its hunger, the mage lords, at the goading of their gods,<br />
									assaulted the Golden City, heart of all creation,<br />
									to take the Maker's power for themselves.<br /></p>

									<p>With magic born of mingled blood and lyrium,<br />
									the Tevinter broke into the Maker's House.<br />
									But the promised power did not await them there.<br /></p>

									<p>The moment they entered the city of the maker, their sin poisoned it.<br />
									What had been golden turned black,<br />
									and violently they were flung from the world of dreams back into the waking world.<br />
									Twisted and corrupted by their crime and their magic into monsters,<br />
									they fled underground,<br />
									unable to bear the light of day.<br />
									The first darkspawn.<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 8:21-27</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Threnodies 12</span></p>

									<p>Those who had sought to claim<br />
									Heaven by violence destroyed it. What was<br />
									Golden and pure turned black.<br />
									Those who had once been mage-lords,<br />
									The brightest of their age,<br />
									Were no longer men, but monsters<br /></p>
									<p>—Threnodies 12:1</p>

									<p>All that the Maker has wrought is in His hand<br />
									Beloved and precious to Him.<br />
									Where the Maker has turned His face away,<br />
									Is a Void in all things;<br />
									In the world, in the Fade,<br />
									In the hearts and minds of men.<br /></p>

									<p>Passing out of the world, in that Void shall they wander;<br />
									O unrepentant, faithless, treacherous,<br />
									They who are judged and found wanting<br />
									Shall know forever the loss of the Maker's love.<br />
									Only Our Lady shall weep for them.<br /></p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Transfigurations 1</span></p>

									<p><strong>The Commandments</strong><br />
									<p>These truths the Maker has revealed to me:<br />
									As there is but one world,<br />
									One life, one death, there is<br />
									But one god, and He is our Maker.<br />
									They are sinners, who have given their love<br />
									To false gods.<br /></p>

									<p>Magic exists to serve man, and never to rule over him.<br />
									Foul and corrupt are they<br />
									Who have taken His gift<br />
									And turned it against His children.<br />
									They shall be named Maleficar, accursed ones.<br />
									They shall find no rest in this world<br />
									Or beyond.<br /></p>

									<p>All men are the Work of our Maker's Hands,<br />
									From the lowest slaves<br />
									To the highest kings.<br />
									Those who bring harm<br />
									Without provocation to the least of His children<br />
									Are hated and accursed by the Maker.<br /></p>

									<p>Those who bear false witness<br />
									And work to deceive others, know this:<br />
									There is but one Truth.<br />
									All things are known to our Maker<br />
									And He shall judge their lies.<br /></p>

									<p>All things in this world are finite.<br />
									What one man gains, another has lost.<br />
									Those who steal from their brothers and sisters<br />
									Do harm to their livelihood and to their peace of mind.<br />
									Our Maker sees this with a heavy heart.<br /></p>

									<p>The one who repents, who has faith,<br />
									Unshaken by the darkness of the world,<br />
									She shall know true peace.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste's Sermon at Valarian Fields</strong><br />
									<p>Many are those who wander in sin,<br />
									Despairing that they are lost forever,<br />
									But the one who repents, who has faith<br />
									Unshaken by the darkness of the world,<br />
									And boasts not, nor gloats<br />
									Over the misfortunes of the weak, but takes delight<br />
									In the Maker's law and creations, she shall know<br />
									The peace of the Maker's benediction.<br />
									The Light shall lead her safely<br />
									Through the paths of this world, and into the next.<br />
									For she who trusts in the Maker, fire is her water.<br />
									As the moth sees light and goes toward flame,<br />
									She should see fire and go towards Light.<br />
									The Veil holds no uncertainty for her,<br />
									And she will know no fear of death, for the Maker<br />
									Shall be her beacon and her shield, her foundation and her sword.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Andraste's Prayer before the siege of Minrathous</strong><br />
									<p>O Maker, hear my cry:<br />
									Guide me through the blackest nights.<br />
									Steel my heart against the temptations of the wicked.<br />
									Make me to rest in the warmest places.<br /></p>

									<p>O Creator, see me kneel:<br />
									For I walk only where You would bid me.<br />
									Stand only in places You have blessed.<br />
									Sing only the words You place in my throat.<br /></p>

									<p>My Maker, know my heart:<br />
									Take from me a life of sorrow.<br />
									Lift me from a world of pain.<br />
									Judge me worthy of Your endless pride.<br /></p>

									<p>My Creator, judge me whole:<br />
									Find me well within Your grace.<br />
									Touch me with fire that I be cleansed.<br />
									Tell me I have sung to Your approval.<br /></p>

									<p>O Maker, hear my cry:<br />
									Seat me by Your side in death.<br />
									Make me one within Your glory.<br />
									And let the world once more see Your favor.<br /></p>

									<p><strong>Prayers for the despairing</strong><br />

									<p>Maker, my enemies are abundant.<br />
									Many are those who rise up against me.<br />
									But my faith sustains me; I shall not fear the legion,<br />
									Should they set themselves against me.<br /></p>

									<p>In the long hours of the night<br />
									When hope has abandoned me,<br />
									I will see the stars and know<br />
									Your Light remains.<br /></p>

									<p>I have heard the sound<br />
									A song in the stillness,<br />
									The echo of Your voice,<br />
									Calling creation to wake from its slumber.<br /></p>

									<p>How can we know You?<br />
									In the turning of the seasons, in life and death,<br />
									In the empty space where our hearts<br />
									Hunger for a forgotten face?<br /></p>

									<p>You have walked beside me<br />
									Down the paths where a thousand arrows sought my flesh.<br />
									You have stood with me when all others<br />
									Have forsaken me.<br /></p>

									<p>I have faced armies<br />
									With You as my shield,<br />
									And though I bear scars beyond counting, nothing<br />
									Can break me except Your absence.<br /></p>

									<p>When I have lost all else, when my eyes fail me<br />
									And the taste of blood fills my mouth, then<br />
									In the pounding of my heart<br />
									I hear the glory of creation.<br /></p>

									<p>You have grieved as I have.<br />
									You, who made worlds out of nothing.<br />
									We are alike in sorrow, sculptor and clay,<br />
									Comforting each other in our art.<br /></p>

									<p>Do not grieve for me, Maker of All.<br />
									Though all others may forget You,<br />
									Your name is etched into my every step.<br />
									I will not forsake You, even if I forget myself.<br /></p>

									<p>Maker, though the darkness comes upon me,<br />
									I shall embrace the Light. I shall weather the storm.<br />
									I shall endure.<br />
									What you have created, no one can tear asunder.<br /></p>

									<p>Who knows me as You do?<br />
									You have been there since before my first breath.<br />
									You have seen me when no other would recognize my face.<br />
									You composed the cadence of my heart.<br /></p>

									<p>Through blinding mist, I climb<br />
									A sheer cliff, the summit shrouded in fog, the base<br />
									Endlessly far beneath my feet<br />
									The Maker is the rock to which I cling.<br /></p>

									<p>I cannot see the path.<br />
									Perhaps there is only abyss.<br />
									Trembling, I step forward,<br />
									In darkness enveloped.<br /></p>

									<p>Though all before me is shadow,<br />
									Yet shall the Maker be my guide.<br />
									I shall not be left to wander the drifting roads of the Beyond.<br />
									For there is no darkness in the Maker's Light<br />
									And nothing that He has wrought shall be lost.<br /></p>

									<p>I am not alone. Even<br />
									As I stumble on the path<br />
									With my eyes closed, yet I see<br />
									The Light is here.<br /></p>

									<p>Draw your last breath, my friends.<br />
									Cross the Veil and the Fade and all the stars in the sky.<br />
									Rest at the Maker's right hand,<br />
									And be Forgiven.<br /></p>

									<p>Maker, though I am but one, I have called in Your Name,<br />
									And those who come to serve will know Your Glory.<br />
									I remembered for them.<br />
									They will see what can be gained,<br />
									And though we are few against the wind, we are Yours.<br /></p>
									<p>—Trials 5:1</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Trials 15</span></p>

									<p>Though I am flesh, Your Light is ever present,<br />
									And those I have called, they remember,<br />
									And they shall endure.<br />
									I shall sing with them the Chant, and all will know,<br />
									We are Yours, and none shall stand before us.<br /></p>
									<p>—Trials 15:1</p>

									<p>Now her hand is raised<br />
									A sword to pierce the sun<br />
									With iron shield she defends the faithful<br />
									Let chaos be undone<br /></p>

									<p>This section contains verses from the Chant of Light for which the Canticle is not known.</p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Chanter Devons</span></p>

									<p><strong>Note:</strong> Chanter Devons, by the Lothering Chanter's Board, recites these verses.</p>

									<p>And Eileen spoke unto the masses,<br />
									"My hearth is yours, my bread is yours, my life is yours.<br />
									For all who walk in the sight of the Maker are one."<br /></p>

									<p>Let all repeat the Chant of Light.<br />
									Only the Word dispels the darkness upon us.<br /></p>

									<p>A learned child is a blessing upon his parents and onto the Maker.</p>

									<p>And so Rajmael in the heathen temple recanted.<br />
									"Speak only the Word; sing only the Chant.<br />
									Then the Golden City is thine," spoke Andraste.<br /></p>

									<p>What hath man's sin wrought?</p>

									<p>Let him take notice and shine upon thee, for thou has done His work on this day<br />
									And the stars stood still, the winds did quiet, and all animals of earth and air held their breath<br />
									And all was silent in prayer and thanks.<br /></p>

									<p><span class="span-h5">Other Chanters</span></p>

									<p>Though stung with a hundred arrows,<br />
									Though suffering from ailments both great and small,<br />
									His Heart was strong, and he moved on.<br /></p>

									<p>The deep dark before dawn's first light seems eternal,<br />
									But know that the sun always rises.<br /></p>

									<p>Though the lands suffer a thousand wrongs,<br />
									The Maker yet notices the smallest of deeds.<br /></p>
