						<p>Marked is covered with tattoos representing the runes of war. For many years he wandered around the world with the sole goal of killing as many demons as possible. With each successive demon dead, the Marked One absorbed more and more demonic magic. The result is quick regeneration and enormous strength. Thus, he is also able to use demonic magic.</p>
						<p>It causes an internal conflict in him. Did not, in pursuit of his goal, become what he wanted so much to destroy?</p>

						<p>Jadir leads the Krasians, he is known as the Shar'Dama Ka. That which will unite everyone against the demons. Jadir's body is scarred in the shape of runes. There is no one more trained in the Sharusahk techniques. They serve to use the opponent's strength against himself. He wields his spears just as skilfully.</p>
						<p>His goal is to conquer the entire known world of Sharak Sun, which can be translated as a war in the light of day. He does this to put up the final battle against demons.</p>
