		<p><strong>Choose your savior</strong> website was made based on book. Demon Cycle by Peter V.Brett. This book has special place in my heart, mostly because of characters. While going throught story of book I found self acceptance.This book reminded me that people often see life from their own perspective. For an incomplete picture. To honor what this book did for me I had dicide to make a website.</p>

		<p>The purpose of this website was to choose one of two services to purchase. Thematically, it was a choice between the two protagonists. I wanted this website to be also optimized in terms of mobile devices. What I achieved by starting styling for mobile devices. Then I just started optimizing in terms of desktop devices. The website has navigation to subpages. The subpages were never created because at the beginning of the project I assumed that I would only make the title page.</p>
		<p>I wanted the page to be more lively, so I decided to put a banner under the page navigation. The banner was styled with an attachment fixed. Giving the impression that the site is less static. On the main page, using css, I created a simple imitation of an open book. I achived that by using a gradient. For styling the website colors and text, I used the ": root" pseudo-class to make changes to the page easier. It was my first project that purpose was to make it optymalized for moblie users.</p>
